This is the baseline plot which shows a pretty balanced increase over time.

On this plot I adjusted the time and it showed a larger increase in actual returns and strategy returns.

I tuned this plot by decreasing the window from 100 to 50. This increased the strategy returns drastically. It was higher than the actual returns.

On this plot I added linear regression as a classifer. It caused the largest increase in actual and strategy returns.

#Conclusion

The SMA window tuned plot gave the highest actual and strategy returns. So using a smaller window would be my recommendation out of the few options I've tested.
